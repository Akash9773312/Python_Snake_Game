# Python_Snake_Game
Legendary snake game created using python programming language in just a single folder.
You can copy the code and run the file to play this game.
Modules imported are time, turtle, and random.
Turtle: turtle is a pre-installed Python library that enables users to create pictures and shapes by providing them with a virtual canvas. The onscreen pen that you use for drawing is called the turtle and this is what gives the library its name.
Time: he time() function returns the number of seconds passed since epoch.
Random: Python Random module is an in-built module of Python which is used to generate random numbers. These are pseudo-random numbers means these are not truly random. This module can be used to perform random actions such as generating random numbers, print random a value for a list or string, etc.




Creating a game or any software or any website is not a great idea, one should always use different modules and different files and at last integrate them to give us an final output which will satisfy the principle of low coupling and high cohesion.
